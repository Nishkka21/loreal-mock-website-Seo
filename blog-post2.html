        <p>Your hair deserves the best care, and choosing the right haircare routine can make all the difference. Whether you’re struggling with dryness, damage, or frizz, L’Oréal Paris has a wide range of products designed for every hair type. Let’s dive into how to build the perfect haircare routine for you.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Start with the Right Shampoo</h3>
        <p>The foundation of any good haircare routine is a shampoo tailored to your hair type. If you have dry hair, opt for a hydrating formula like L’Oréal Paris Elvive Extraordinary Oil Shampoo. For those with color-treated hair, a color-safe option like the Elvive Color Vibrancy Protecting Shampoo will help preserve your color longer.</p>

        <h3>2. Condition with Care</h3>
        <p>Conditioners are essential for maintaining hair health. Use a deep conditioner like L’Oréal Paris Elvive Total Repair 5 Conditioner to help repair damaged hair and keep it soft and manageable.</p>

        <h3>3. Add Hair Treatments</h3>
        <p>Enhance your routine with targeted treatments. The Elvive 8 Second Wonder Water is a game-changer for smooth, silky hair, providing salon-like results in just seconds. If your hair is damaged, try the Elvive Dream Lengths No Haircut Cream for split-end prevention.</p>

        <h3>4. Style with Protection</h3>
        <p>Before heat styling, make sure to use a heat protectant like the L’Oréal Paris Elvive Dream Lengths Heat Slayer Pre-Iron Spray. It protects your hair from damage and keeps it looking healthy and sleek.</p>

        <h3>5. Finish with a Shine</h3>
        <p>Finish your routine with a lightweight shine serum like L’Oréal Paris Elvive Extraordinary Oil to add gloss and smoothness.</p>
