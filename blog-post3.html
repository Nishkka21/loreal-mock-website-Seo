        <img src="assets/blog-makeup.jpeg" alt="Makeup Blog">
        <p>The makeup world is constantly evolving, and 2024 is shaping up to be a year of bold, creative looks. Here are five makeup trends that are set to take over the beauty industry this year, and how you can achieve them with L’Oréal Paris products.</p>

        <h3>1. Bold, Bright Lips</h3>
        <p>Say goodbye to nude lips and hello to bold, bright colors. Reds, pinks, and even oranges are going to be huge in 2024. Get the look with L’Oréal Paris Color Riche Satin Lipstick, available in a range of vibrant shades.</p>

        <h3>2. Glossy Skin</h3>
        <p>Matte skin is out, and dewy, glossy skin is in. Achieve the radiant, fresh-faced look with L’Oréal Paris True Match Lumi Glotion, which gives you a natural glow without looking greasy.</p>

        <h3>3. Graphic Eyeliner</h3>
        <p>Step up your eyeliner game with bold, graphic designs. Whether it’s double wings or floating lines, eyeliner is becoming an artistic statement. Try the L’Oréal Paris Infallible Flash Cat Eye Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner for precision and staying power.</p>

        <h3>4. Metallic Eyeshadows</h3>
        <p>Metallic and shimmery eyeshadows are making a comeback. Go for golds, silvers, and other metallic shades to create a dramatic eye look. L’Oréal Paris Brilliant Eyes Shimmer Liquid Eyeshadow will give your lids a high-impact, long-lasting finish.</p>

        <h3>5. Fluffy, Natural Brows</h3>
        <p>Thick, fluffy brows are here to stay. Keep your brows looking full but natural with L’Oréal Paris Unbelieva-Brow Longwear Waterproof Brow Gel. Brush them up and lock them in place for an all-day hold.</p>
